## Description
The goal of this project is to create a quiz from scratch. When starting the quiz, you will have a list of answers to choose from and if you choose a wrong answer, seconds will be deducted from your current time. When either the time has run out or you have answered all questions, the results will appear with your current score. You can enter your initials and your results will be added onto a scoreboard. You can clear the scoreboard.
